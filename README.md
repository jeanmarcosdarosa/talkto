CoffeeTalkTo is a very simple [TalkTo API](http://talkto.com/developer/) client written in PHP. No DB- files are written to text files that match ```person_id``` and ```place_id```.

#### Make sure you have a ```data``` directory at the root level that is writable by PHP.

#### Put your api key in config.json at the root level like this:
```
{
  "api_key": "your_api_key"
}
```
